# 🔐 CryptoVault — Encrypted Password Manager (Research Prototype)

A secure Android app for storing passwords and sensitive user data using device-bound encryption. Each entry is encrypted uniquely per device, ensuring maximum security. Developed as a research prototype with an accompanying university research paper on secure mobile storage.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Store and manage passwords securely with device-tied encryption  
- ✅ Encrypted local storage using Room Encrypted  
- ✅ Intuitive and responsive UI with Jetpack Compose  
- ✅ Modular architecture for maintainability and scalability  
- ✅ Implemented secure serialization and decryption flows  
- ✅ Research-backed approach for secure mobile storage  

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Kotlin  
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose  
- **Architecture:** MVVM, Clean Architecture  
- **DI:** Dagger  
- **Database:** Room (Encrypted)  
- **Other:** Security best practices, Encryption algorithms, Research & Development

## ⚙️ How It Works
CryptoVault encrypts each password entry using a **device-unique key** stored locally. Data is persisted in **Encrypted Room** to ensure security even if the device is compromised. Encryption and decryption flows are optimized for performance and smooth UX. The approach was validated via a **research paper** on secure mobile storage architecture.

## 🧠 Highlights / Learning Outcomes
- Implemented device-bound encryption for maximum security  
- Ensured secure storage and serialization of sensitive data  
- Authored and defended a university research paper on mobile encryption  
- Applied modular design and clean architecture for maintainability
